# Binary-Search-Tree, Spring 2016
This is a project for my Spring 2016 Data Structures and Algorithms class. It implements a binary search tree that sorts items as they are input, and has options to traverse the tree in different ways.

A full description of the assignment is available in DSBinarySearchTreeLabDescription.pdf

binarysearchtree.ads is the specification for the generic binary search tree.

binarysearchtree.adb is the implementation of the generic binary search tree.

Genericbinarysearchtreedriver.adb is the actual implementation of the main lab.

Input.txt and Output.txt are the inputs and outputs for an example running of the program.

This program includes methods to insert, find iteratively and recursively, find the in order successor, traverse the tree in preorder, traverse the tree in post order iteratively and recursively, and traverse the tree in reverse in order.
